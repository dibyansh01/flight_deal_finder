<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Create an app that recommends the best flight deals.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Its a personal API based project to find flight deals based on the provided destinations and your expected price range.</li>
  <li>Here i have used 3 APIs:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Sheety API (for my destination and price range input </li>
    <li>Twilio API (for text notification) </li> 
    <li>Tequila API (for fetching flight deals)</li>
  </ol>
<li>Since it is a beginner level project, All APIs used are of free version. And for testing your own version of the program, you need to create your personal account on the above mentioned API platforms or you can also use different APIs as per your choice.</li>
<li>You will find "Your_API_Key" mentioned in the place of api credentials, Because i have used my personal account for the same and it can not be used by another person.</li>
<li>You can customize this project as per your imagination and let others know the beauty of your imagination.</li>
</ul>
